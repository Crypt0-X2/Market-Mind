## What is MarketMind?

**MarketMind** is an intelligent multi-agent system designed to streamline comprehensive financial market analysis. It orchestrates specialized AI agents that work collaboratively to fetch live market data, analyze news sentiment, generate actionable insights, and create compelling visualizations for both Indian and global stocks.

The system operates asynchronously using a supervisor-agent architecture, making it ideal for building intelligence into financial dashboards, research tools, algorithmic trading systems, or data science pipelines.

## How MarketMind Works

### Agent Workflow
MarketMind operates through a coordinated workflow of specialized agents:

1. **Supervisor Agent** initializes and orchestrates the entire analysis pipeline
2. **Market Data Agent** fetches real-time stock prices and historical data for specified companies
3. **Sentiment Agent** retrieves latest financial news and performs sentiment analysis using VADER
4. **Insight Agent** combines market data and sentiment to generate AI-powered investment insights
5. **Visualization Agent** creates charts and visual representations of the analysis

### Data Flow
```
Input: Company Names/Tickers
    ↓
Market Data Agent → Live Stock Prices, Volume, OHLC Data
    ↓
Sentiment Agent → Financial News + Sentiment Scores
    ↓
Insight Agent → AI Analysis + Investment Recommendations
    ↓
Visualization Agent → Charts, Graphs, Visual Analytics
    ↓
Output: Comprehensive Financial Report
```

### User Interfaces
- **Command Line**: Run `python main.py` for batch analysis and console output
- **Streamlit Web App**: Interactive dashboard with real-time charts and insights
- **Programmatic API**: Use individual agents in your own Python applications

---

## Quickstart

### 1. Install Dependencies

From the root directory (`MarketMind/`):

```bash
cd MarketMind-agents
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Also download required NLTK data:

```bash
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('vader_lexicon')"
```

### 2. Add Your API Keys

In `MarketMind/`, create a `.env` file:

```env
NEWSAPI_KEY=your_newsapi_key_here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key_here
```

### 3. Set Up Google Cloud (Optional but recommended)

Authenticate and configure the project:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud config set project your-project-id
```

### 4. (Optional) Initialize Data

Run the data fetchers (only once):

```bash
python notebooks/init_bigquery.py
python notebooks/save_news_sample.py
```

### 5. Run the Agent Workflow

```bash
python main.py
```

This will execute the entire agent pipeline: fetching data, analyzing sentiment, generating insights, and saving output.

### 6. Launch the UI

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Use this to explore company insights visually using the dashboard.
